      Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to
      find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays. Union
      of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements
      from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence
      of element should be printed in the union. Note : Elements are not
      necessarily distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input: 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 Output: 5 Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the
      elements which comes in the union set of both arrays. So count is 5.

      var arr_a = [1, 2, 3];
      var arr_b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      var len = 0;
      var distinct_arr = [];
      if (arr_a.length <= arr_b.length) {
        len = arr_b.length;
      } else {
        len = arr_a.length;
      }
      for (var i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        if (i <= arr_a.length && i <= arr_b.length) {
          if (arr_a[i - 1] == arr_b[i - 1]) {
            distinct_arr.push(arr_a[i - 1]);
          }
        }
      }
      console.log(distinct_arr);
