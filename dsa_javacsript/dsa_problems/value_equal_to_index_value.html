    <p>
      Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the
      elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider
      1-based indexing ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the
      same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index.
      Follows 1-based indexing of the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input: N = 5 Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7} Output: 2 Explanation: Only Arr[2]
      = 2 exists here.
    </p>
    <script>
      var n = 5;
      var arr = [15, 2, 45, 12, 7];
      var index = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == i + 1) {
          index.push(arr[i]);
        }
      }
      console.log(index);
    </script>
